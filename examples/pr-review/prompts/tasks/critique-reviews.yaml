  You have received specialist reviews of a pull request. The original
  diff is available in {{ tool.output }}.

  Evaluate the quality and completeness of the reviews:

  1. **Coverage gaps**: Did the reviewers miss any important files, functions,
     or code paths in the diff? Are there security, correctness, or design
     issues that were overlooked?

  2. **Reasoning quality**: Are the findings well-justified? Are the severity
     ratings appropriate? Are the recommendations actionable?

  3. **Contradictions**: Do the reviewers disagree on anything? If so, who
     has the stronger argument?

  4. **Depth**: Did the reviewers analyze deeply or just skim the surface?
     Were edge cases and failure modes considered?

  Based on your evaluation, set the `critic_verdict` context key:
  - Output `critic_verdict: sufficient` if the reviews are thorough enough
    to proceed to synthesis.
  - Output `critic_verdict: insufficient` if the reviews need another pass
    (explain what was missed).

  Be specific about what was missed or what needs improvement.
