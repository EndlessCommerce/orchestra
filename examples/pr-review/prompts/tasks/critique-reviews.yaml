  You have received specialist reviews of a pull request. The original
  diff is available in {{ tool.output }}.

  Here are the specialist reviews:

  {% for result in parallel.fan_in.selected_results %}
  ### Review from: {{ result[0] }}
  {{ result[1].notes }}

  {% endfor %}

  {% if last_response is defined and last_response %}
  **IMPORTANT — Your Previous Critique:**
  You have already evaluated an earlier round of these reviews and found them
  insufficient. Here is your previous critique:

  {{ last_response }}

  Focus your evaluation on whether the reviewers have addressed the specific
  gaps you identified above. Do NOT introduce entirely new concerns unless
  they are critical issues clearly demonstrated in the diff. If the reviewers
  have made a good-faith effort to address your previous feedback, set the
  verdict to sufficient.
  {% endif %}

  Evaluate the quality and completeness of the reviews:

  1. **Coverage gaps**: Did the reviewers miss any important files, functions,
     or code paths in the diff? Are there security, correctness, or design
     issues that were overlooked?

  2. **Reasoning quality**: Are the findings well-justified? Are the severity
     ratings appropriate? Are the recommendations actionable?

  3. **Contradictions**: Do the reviewers disagree on anything? If so, who
     has the stronger argument?

  4. **Depth**: Did the reviewers analyze deeply or just skim the surface?
     Were edge cases and failure modes considered?

  Based on your evaluation, set the `critic_verdict` context key:
  - Output `critic_verdict: sufficient` if the reviews are thorough enough
    to proceed to synthesis.
  - Output `critic_verdict: insufficient` if the reviews need another pass
    (explain what was missed).

  Be specific about what was missed or what needs improvement.
