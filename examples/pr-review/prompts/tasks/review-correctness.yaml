  Review this pull request from a **correctness** perspective.

  For each finding, provide:
  - **File and line** (if identifiable from the diff)
  - **Severity**: critical / high / medium / low
  - **Category**: e.g. logic error, edge case, race condition, error handling
  - **Description**: the incorrect behavior and a scenario that triggers it
  - **Recommendation**: specific fix

  Consider:
  - Does the code do what the PR description claims?
  - Are edge cases handled (empty inputs, nulls, boundaries)?
  - Are error paths handled gracefully?
  - Could any change break existing callers or invariants?

  End with a verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT.
