  {% endif %}

  For each finding, provide:
  - **File and line** (if identifiable from the diff)
  - **Severity**: critical / high / medium / low
  - **Category**: e.g. injection, auth bypass, data exposure, dependency risk
  - **Description**: what the vulnerability is and how it could be exploited
