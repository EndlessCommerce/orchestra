  Review this pull request from an **architecture** perspective.

  The diff is available in {{ tool.output }}.

  For each finding, provide:
  - **File and line** (if identifiable from the diff)
  - **Severity**: high / medium / low
  - **Category**: e.g. coupling, abstraction leak, API surface, dependency direction, pattern violation
  - **Description**: what the architectural concern is and its long-term impact
  - **Recommendation**: specific refactoring or design alternative

  Consider:
  - Does this change respect existing module boundaries?
  - Are new dependencies introduced in the right direction?
  - Is the abstraction level appropriate (not too high, not too low)?
  - Does it follow established patterns in the codebase?
  - Will this change make future modifications harder?

  If the PR has no architectural concerns, state that explicitly.

  End with a verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT.
