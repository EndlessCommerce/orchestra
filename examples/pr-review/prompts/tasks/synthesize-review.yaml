  You have received independent reviews from specialist reviewers.

  The original diff is available in {{ tool.output }}.

  Here are the specialist reviews:

  {% for result in parallel.fan_in.selected_results %}
  ### Review from: {{ result[0] }}
  {{ result[1].notes }}

  {% endfor %}

  Synthesize them into a single, unified PR review:

  1. **Summary**: one-paragraph assessment of the PR's overall quality.
  2. **Blocking issues**: findings that must be fixed before merge,
     de-duplicated and ordered by severity.
  3. **Suggestions**: non-blocking improvements worth considering.
  4. **Verdict**: one of APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT.
     - REQUEST_CHANGES if any reviewer found a critical or high issue.
     - APPROVE if all reviewers approved with at most low/nitpick findings.
     - COMMENT otherwise.

  Be concise. Do not repeat the full text of each review — distill
  the key points and reference the original reviewer (security /
  quality / correctness) for attribution.
