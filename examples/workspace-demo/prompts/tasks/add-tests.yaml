  Use the `project__read-file` tool to read `calculator.py`, then write comprehensive pytest tests for it.

  Your tests should cover:
  1. Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with positive numbers
  2. Operations with negative numbers and zero
  3. The divide-by-zero error case
  4. Large numbers and floating-point precision

  Use the `project__write-file` tool to write the tests to `test_calculator.py`.
  Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested.

  After writing the tests, use the `project__run-tests` tool to run them and verify they pass.
